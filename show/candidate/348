/*

	I have found a way of creating the ultimate WINNING CHALLENGE.

I know, "No #include is allowed in the source code", but who cares!

Apart from that, I only used the normal submission procedure (no intrusion into the SYSTEM!)

Just try BREAKING my CHALLENGE: after all, the SYSTEM is kind enough to provide you with a pairtext/ciphertext pair!

/*

	I am still upset by what has just happened.

Mr. Hyde has left some notes explaining how he managed to have his devilish CHALLENGE accepted.

I cannot reveal the details for now. I first have to clarify all this...

Maybe I will have to burn those notes...

			Dr. Jekyll

P.S.: I have just realized that the notes also contain the secret key
	  and I have decided to BREAK the CHALLENGE myself,
	  for the sake the WhibOx Contest!
